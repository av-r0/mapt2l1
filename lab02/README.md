### IEiT-EAT-1 MaPT2

#### Lectures 
Jarosław Bułat, course coordinator (kwant@agh.edu.pl).
#### Laboratory 
Andres Vejar (avejar@agh.edu.pl) and Faysal Marzuk (marzuk@agh.edu.pl)

### Course Information
#### Attendance
1. Laboratory classes are scheduled every week on Mondays.
2. Student attendance during laboratory classes is mandatory.
3. It is not allowed to make up past laboratory classes in case of absence.
4. One unexcused laboratory absence during the course is permitted.
5. Each subsequent unexcused absence decreases the final grade by 0.5 points.
6. Unexcused absence of 20% of the classes or more cancels the right to retake
   the laboratory or exam after the first failed approach (according to
   the rules of AGH-UST).
#### Laboratory topics
- C++ 
- introduction to Matlab.
- introduction to Python.

#### Final grade
1. Students during the semester can obtain points from:
  - Laboratory reports, with due one week after the lesson. Further
    instructions to submit your reports are available at
    (https://upel.agh.edu.pl/course/view.php?id=3610).
  - Two tests, one from C++ topics and the second one from the Matlab and
    Python topics.  Each class test would be several multiple-choice
    questions and a few questions based on writing programs/codes.
2. More than 50% of the total number of points is required to pass the
   laboratory part of the course.
3. Final laboratory mark grade is determined by converting the obtained
   number of points according to the AGH-UST Regulations of Study
   (https://www.agh.edu.pl/fileadmin/default/templates/images/dokumenty/uchwaly_senatu/2017/0426/26_04_2017_42_.pdf)
4. Alternative option of passing the MaPT laboratory classes: a project in
   C++ presented before the end of the semester.
